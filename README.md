# k6 Operator

`grafana/k6-operator` is a Kubernetes operator for running distributed [k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6) tests in your cluster. k6 Operator introduces two CRDs:

- `TestRun` CRD
- `PrivateLoadZone` CRD

The `TestRun` CRD is a representation of a single k6 test executed once. `TestRun` supports various configuration options that allow you to adapt to different Kubernetes setups. You can find a description of the more common options [here](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/set-up-distributed-k6/usage/common-options/), and the full list of options can be found in the [definition itself](https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator/blob/main/config/crd/bases/k6.io_testruns.yaml).

The `PrivateLoadZone` CRD is a representation of a [load zone](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/author-run/use-load-zones/), which is a k6 term for a set of nodes within a cluster designated to execute k6 test runs. `PrivateLoadZone` is integrated with [Grafana Cloud k6](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/k6/) and requires a [Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user). You can find a guide describing how to set up a `PrivateLoadZone` [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/testing/k6/author-run/private-load-zone-v2/), while billing details can be found [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/cost-management-and-billing/understand-your-invoice/k6-invoice/).

## Documentation

### Development

<!-- TODO: pull out into contributing guide -->

When submitting a PR, it's preferable to work on an open issue. If an issue does not exist, create it. An issue allows us to validate the problem, gather additional feedback from the community, and avoid unnecessary work.

<!-- 
Some GitHub issues have a ["good first issue" label](https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These are the issues that should be good for newcomers. The issues with the ["help wanted" label](https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are the ones that could use some community help or additional user feedback. -->

There are many options for setting up a local Kubernetes cluster for development, and any of them can be used for local development of the k6 Operator. One option is to create a [kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

Additionally, you'll need to install the following tooling:

- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
- [operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/): optional as most common changes can be done without it

To execute unit tests, use these commands:

```bash
make test-setup # only need to run once
make test
```

To execute e2e test locally:

- `make e2e` for kustomize and `make e2e-helm` for Helm
- validate tests have been run
- `make e2e-cleanup`
